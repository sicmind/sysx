# sysx
HTML/Javascript based MIDI SYSEX editing tools

### Goals

1.	Render all editable sysex parameters as a javascript object
2.	Make it possible to "transcribe" a specificaiton manual to instrument definition
3.	Allow for open ended interface design using HTML components

### To run
1. `git clone git@github.com:midispecs-org/sysx.git`
2. `cd sysx`
3. `npm install`
4. `npm start --open`

#### _Notes_
* _this was forked for reference and updated based on the repo at [sicmind/sysx](https://github.com/sicmind/sysx)._
* _while the code is incomplete, there are some solid ideas here around abstracting MIDI / Sysex communication with hardware._
